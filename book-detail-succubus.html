        <p><strong>Description:</strong> I was grinning as I hugged him, too overwhelmed to form any other logical greeting or even ask why he was here.
        The last time I’d seen Bastien had been in Seattle last fall. He’d come to town to help discredit a conservative radio host and had succeeded (thanks to me), earning him accolades from our superiors. I’d lost touch with him shortly thereafter and had thought he’d been transferred to Europe or the East Coast. Maybe he had been, but he was here now. The full impact of Luis’s earlier words came back to me as I stepped away from Bastien.
        “Wait. You’re the other new employee?”
        Bastien’s grin widened. He loved being able to shock and surprise me. “Afraid so, Fleur. I moved here a week ago, and our employer was kind enough to put me up here while I look for a place of my own.” He swept Luis a gallant bow.
         Luis nodded back, clearly enjoying the scenario he’d created.
